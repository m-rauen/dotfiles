### :information_source: Information

---

Just a repo to maintain and easily swap between differente machines and setups.

### :computer: Installation 

---

`install.sh` it's a **working in progress** shell scripts that will check for some commands and applications in your system and install it, if that's the case. For `git clone` commands I already passed the specific git link to clone the repo into some specific directory in my home folder (e.g. `git clone <link> ~/.directory-name`), and, if the folder already exists (meaning I have already installed that), than will just echo an error in the terminal and proceed with the others commands. 

As I said, the script isn't finished at the moment, however, it already can help me in some basic stuff. Feel free to copy it or improved it. :smile:
