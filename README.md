Just a repo to maintain and easily swap between differente machines and setups.

### :computer: Installation 

---

`install.sh` it's a **working in progress** shell scripts that will check for some commands and applications in your system and install it, if that's the case. To use the script and simply:

```
  git clone https://github.com/m-rauen/dotfiles.git ~/your-desired-path 
  cd ~/your-desired-path 
  ./install.sh
```



As I said, the script isn't finished at the moment, however, it already can help me in some basic stuff. Feel free to copy it or improved it. :smile:
