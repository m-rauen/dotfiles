# Coordinate_Analyzer
⚠️ Coordinate_Analyzer is a **(working in progress)** CLI Python program.  

### Basic Information  
***
:dart: The main objective of the program it is to compare 2 molecular structures, based on their atomic coordinates, and do a simply (but efficient) mathematical comparasion througout RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) and Kabsch algorithm.    

:dart: One of the major aspects here it is to be able to tell the major and minimal differences between 2 molecular structures after they have gone through any path. For example, comparing the final molecular geometry, after a optimization process, with the starting one.
